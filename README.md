# p5.js Recording Template
 A simple p5 code template to be run on a local server (tested using atom live server), using Trevor Sundberg's web H.264 mp4 encoder to allow recording videos.

 To use, clone the folder / download it as a zip + extract, and put any p5 code into the sketch.js file in the js folder. NB: This does use instanced mode for scripting, so any p5 functions or variables must be written with a 'p.' beforehand - i.e., "createCanvas(400, 400)" becomes "p.createCanvas(400, 400)". I might consider adding in functionality to import from a p5 web editor sketch at a later date.
